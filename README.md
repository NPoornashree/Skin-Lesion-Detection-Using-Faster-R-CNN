# SkinLesionDetectionUsingFaster-R-CNN
Worked in a team of 4 to build an intelligent image-based medical diagnosis system. The project is coded in Python and uses the Faster R-CNN algorithm to classify a given skin lesion image into three categories: benign, malignant, and vascular. The input images are initially annotated using the online tool makesense.ai and the annotated images are then subjected to segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. This computer-aided diagnostics technique allows dermatologists to classify skin lesions with higher diagnostic accuracy.
